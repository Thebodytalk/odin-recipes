This project will be my first html website while going through The 
Odin Project. It will include and index page with links to recipes.
It should include things such as links for navigating, ordered and
unordered lists, images, along with others and the boilerplate info 
needed for a basic html page. In the future I expect to come back and
spruce it up a bit with some CSS.
