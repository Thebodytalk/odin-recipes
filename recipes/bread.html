            <h3>Description</h3>
           <p>This homemade bread is one I've made personally. I followed a youtube video and a lot of adjustments I had made by feel so keep that in mind. We can call it a 'working' recipe that makes two loaves!</p>    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups warm water</li>
                <li>1.5 tablespoons of Active Dry Yeast</li>
                <li>8-10 tablespoons of sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of oil</li>
                <li>Pinch or two of salt</li>
                <li>5.5 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Put 2 cups of lukewarm water into a mixing bowl and add 1.5 tablespoons of Active Dry Yeast. Yeast should be fully activated in <em>approximately</em> 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>After yeast has proofed add 8-10 tablespoons of sugar, a pinch or two of salt, and 1/4 cup of oil. Whisk ingredients in mixing bowl until sugar is dissolved. </li>
                <li>Add 3 cups of flour to mixing bowl to begin and mix with fingers until you get a sticky-soupy texture. Add another 1 1/2 cup of flour and continue mixing. If dough still sticks to your fingers as you are mixing add flour in 1/2 cup increments until it no longer sticks to your hands.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle some flour on a clean flat surface and begin kneading dough. Basically fold the dough over on itself and use your palms to push down on it. If dough gets sticky again just grab another pinch of flour and add to dough.</li>
                <li>Once you can poke dough with your finger and it bounces back and is not too sticky and not too dry, put a small amount of oil in mixing bowl and place dough back in it. Make sure dough is oiled up as well as bowl, place a towel or plastic wrap over mixing bowl and let dough rise in a warm place for 60-90 minutes until it has doubled in size.</li>
                <li>When dough has doubled in size just straight up <strong>punch it</strong>. Let dough deflate while you get two bread pans oiled up. Split dough in half and place into pans and let dough rise for about 30 minutes while you preheat oven to 350&deg.</li>
                <li>Place in over on center rack for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Immediately upon removal from oven brush butter on top of the loaves and let cool.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve for everyone to enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
